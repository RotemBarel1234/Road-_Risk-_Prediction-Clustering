Road Risk Analysis: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
This project focuses on analyzing road accident risks using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict risk levels in road accident data and identify distinct clusters of high-risk areas.

Key Features
Supervised Learning: Classification models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, k-NN) were used to predict accident severity.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) were applied to identify high-risk zones.
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA was employed to enhance clustering results and visualize the data.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most critical factors affecting road accident risks.
Project Goals
Predict accident severity based on various road and demographic features.
Discover patterns in accident data by clustering similar areas.
Provide actionable insights to improve road safety and reduce accident risks.
